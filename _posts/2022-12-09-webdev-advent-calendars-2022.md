tweet: "Advent calendars I follow this year. #adventCalendar2022"

Last year I tried to follow too many advent calendars, so naturally I
more or less stopped reading them after a week or so. This year I'm
limiting myself up three, maybe four:

- [Web Performance Calendar](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2022) never
  disappoints. Topic range from basics all the way to nerdy, in depth
  diveâ€“ins.
- I did not follow [HTMHell Advent
  calendar](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar) before, but it seems
  to be something right up my alley.
- I'm not particularly a React fan, but doing most of my work in it, I
  also subscribed to [React Holiday](https://react.holiday).
- [12 Days of Web](https://12daysofweb.dev) starts at 13th of December.
  Let's see if I'll be still reading those by then. ðŸ˜…
