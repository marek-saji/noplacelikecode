dd(1) is a tool that you can use for, for example, backup the whole disk partition. Unfortunatelly it does not show progress, so you donâ€™t really know how long will it take.



On the other hand, yes you can. Just add this to your .bashrc:

```sh
ddv ()
{ 
    dd "$@" & pid=$!
    printf "dd(1) forked, pid=%d\n\n" $pid
    while test -e /proc/$pid; do
        sleep 3
        kill -USR1 $pid
    done
}
```


Voila, this will send dd process in the background and send a USR1 signal to it every 3s, which makes it display the progress.
